# Simple VSCode Project Manager

## Generating App guide

Navigate to the project directory and run the following commands

1. Type: `yarn` to install dependencies
2. For running in dev mode: `yarn start`
3. For packaging the app, run: `yarn dist`, it should create a **dist** folder with all the executable files.
4. Install and enjoy :)
